<h3>
<span>THOMAS MORE AND JOHN FISHER.</span>
</h3>

<p>Although I am afraid
 "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>" may not be considered as open
to contributions purely bibliographical, and admitting I am uncertain
whether the following copy of the treatise of John Fisher, Bishop of
Rochester, has been before noted, I am induced to send this extract from
Techener's <i>Bulletin du Bibliophile</i> for May 1851. The book is in the
library at Douai.</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "This Treatise concernynge the fruytful Saynges of David the King
   and prophete in the seven penytencyall psalmes, devyded in <i>ten</i>
   sermons, was made and compyled by the ryght reverente fader in
   god Johan Fyssher, doctour of dyvinyte and bysshop of Rochester,
   at the exortacion and sterynge of the most excellent pryncesse
   Margarete, Countesse of Richemount and Derby, and moder to out
   souverayne Lorde Kynge H&#275;ry the VII."</p>

<p>It is described as a small 4to., printed upon vellum, in Gothic letters,
at London, 1508, by Wynkyn de Worde, and contains 146 leaves. On the
first leaf it has a portcullis, crowned with the motto "Dieu et mon
Droit." On the recto of the last leaf there is&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Here endeth the exposycyon of the 7 psalmes. Enprynted at London
   in the fletestrete, at the sygne of y<span class="topnum">e</span> Sonne, by Wynkyn de
   Worde. In the yere of oure lorde
<span class="smcap lowercase">M.CCCCC.VIII.</span> y<span class="topnum">e</span>
16 day of y<span class="topnum">e</span>
   moneth of Juyn. The <span class="smcap lowercase">XXIII.</span> yere of y<span class="topnum">e</span> reygne of our souverayne
   Lorde Kynge H&#275;ry the Seventh."</p>

<p>At the back, there is the sun, the monogram of Wynkyn de Worde&mdash;the
letters W. C. displayed as usual&mdash;and beneath, "Wynkyn de Worde."</p>

<p>At the beginning of the book, "sur une garde en vélin" (a fly-leaf of
vellum?), there is written in a very neat hand the following ten verses,
the profession of faith of Thomas Morus and of his friend John Fisher,
Bishop of Rochester:</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p>  "The surest meanes for to attaine</p>
      <p>The perfect waye to endlesse blisse</p>
      <p>Are happie lief and to remaine</p>
    <p>  W<span class="topnum">th</span>in y<span class="topnum">e</span> church where virtue is;</p>
      <p>And if thy conscience be sae sounde</p>
      <p>To thinse thy faith is truth indeede</p>
      <p>Beware in thee noe schisme be founde</p>
     <p> That unitie may have her meede;</p>
     <p> If unitie thow doe embrace</p>
      <p>In heaven (<i>en</i>?)joy possesse thy place."</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Beneath&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"Qui non rectè vivit in unitate ecclesiæ</p>
     <p> Catholicæ, salvus esse non potest."</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">And lower on the same page&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"Thomas Morus dn&#772;s cancellarius Angliæ</p>
      <p>Joh. Fisher Epûs Roffensis."</p>

</div>

<p>It is traditionally reported, upon the testimony of some Anglican
Benedictines (an order now extinct), that the lines which contain the
profession of faith, and those which follow, are in the handwriting of
Bishop Fisher, and that the work was<a id="Page_418"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[418]</span>
 presented by him to the
chancellor, during their imprisonment, when by order of Henry VIII. the
chancellor was denied the consolation of his books.</p>

<p>In the same library there is a fine Psalter, which belonged to Queen
Elizabeth. The <i>Livre d'Heures</i> of Mary Queen of Scots was here also to
be found: "Maria, glorious martyr and Queen of Scotland." It is
conjectured these books were brought to Douai by the fugitive English
Roman Catholic priests. In 1790 their collections were confiscated and
given to the public library of Douai. It would be of interest to
ascertain, if possible, the authenticity of the <i>Heures à l'Usage</i>,
stated to have belonged to Mary Queen of Scots. Upon this point one may
be permitted to be sceptical. I have myself seen two. One of these, it
was said, had been used by Mary on the scaffold, and contained a note in
the handwriting, as I think, of James II. attesting the fact. It was
understood to have been obtained from a monastery in France. The other,
a small Prayer Book MS. in vellum, of good execution, had the signature
"M." with a line I think over it of "O Lord, deliver me from my
enemies!" in French. I am, however, now writing from memory, and, in the
first case, of very many years.</p>

<p>Whether the line, "Maria, glorious martyr and Queen of Scotland," be
written in the Psalter, or has been added by the mental excitement of M.
Duthill&oelig;ul, the librarian at Douai, I cannot decide. The grand
culmination of "and Queen of Scotland" forms doubtless a very striking
anti-thesis: but neither the possessor of the book nor a priest would
have so sunk the martyr, although a woman and a queen were alike
concerned, as this line does. Lowndes states there is a copy of the
bishop's treatise on vellum at Cambridge. A copy is in the British
Museum; but the title, according, to Lowndes, has <i>seven</i> sermons. It
will be observed the title now given has <i>ten</i>.</p>

<h3>
<span>NOTES ON NEWSPAPERS.</span>
</h3>

<p>The social elements of society in the seventeenth century were more
simple in their character and development than at the present period.
The population was comparatively small, and therefore the strivings for
success in any pursuit did not involve that severe conflict which is so
frequently the case in the present day. Society then was more of a
community than it is now. It had not public bodies to aid it. It was
left more to its own inherent resources for reciprocal good, and for
mutual help. The temptations to evade and dissemble, in matters of
business, or private and public negotiations, were not so strong as they
now are. Its transactions were more transparent and defined, because
they were fewer and less complicated than many of our own. We readily
grant that society now, in its social, religious, and commercial
aspects, enjoys advantages immeasurably superior to those of any former
period; still there are some few advantages which it had then, that it
cannot possess now. The following advertisements, from the newspapers of
the time, will illustrate the truth of the foregoing remarks:</p>

<p>From a <i>Collection for Improvement of Husbandry and Trade</i>.</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> Friday, January 26, 1693/4.</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"One that is fit to keep a Warehouse, be a Steward, or do any
   Business that can be supposed an intelligent Man that has been a
   Shopkeeper is fit for, and can give any Security that can be
   desired, as far as Ten Thousand Pound goes, and has some Estate
   of his own, desires an Employment of One hundred Pounds a year,
   or upwards. I can give an account of him."</p>

<p>That a man having 10,000<i>l.</i> to give as security, and in possession of
an estate, should require a situation of 100<i>l.</i> per annum, sounds oddly
enough in our ears. "I can give an account of him," denotes that the
editor was a man well known and duly appreciated. He appears to have
been a scribe useful in many ways. He was known, and knowing.</p>

  <p class="blockquot">Friday, February 2, 1693/4.</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "A very eminent Brewer, and one I know to be a very honest
   Gentleman, wants an Apprentice. I can give an account of him."</p>

<p>In what sense the word "honest" must here be taken it is difficult to
define. As an eminent brewer, we should naturally conclude he must have
been an honest man. He is here very eminent and very honest.</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> Friday March 16, 1693/4.</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Many Masters want Apprentices, and many Youths want Masters. If
   they apply themselves to me, I'll strive to help them. Also for
   variety of valuable services."</p>

<p>Here is the editor of a paper offering his help to masters and
apprentices for their mutual good. Let us suppose an advertisement of
this kind appearing in <i>The Times</i> of our own day. Printing-house Square
would not contain a tithe of the individuals who would present
themselves for the reception of this accommodating aid. In such a case
the editors (as it regards their particular duties) would be cyphers,
for a continuous absorption of their time would necessarily occur in the
carrying out of this benevolent offer. This advertisement may be
considered as <i>multum in parvo</i>, giving the wants of the many in an
announcement of three or four lines, connecting them with a variety of
services which in those days were thought to be valuable. How greatly
are we assisted by these little incidents in forming correct views of
the state of society at that period.</p>

<p>The next advertisement shows the value set upon the services of one who
was to perform the duties of a clerk, and to play well on the
violin.<a id="Page_419"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[419]</span></p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "If any young Man that plays well on a Violin, and writes a good
   Hand, desires a Clerkship, I can help him to Twenty Pounds a
   year."</p>

<p>Of course twenty pounds was of more value then than it is now: still it
seems a small sum for the performance of such duties, for twelve months.

<h3>
<span>TREATISE OF EQUIVOCATION.</span>
</h3>

<p>As having originated the inquiry in
 "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span>
Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>"<a id="queries1"></a><a title="Go to footnote 1." href="#fn1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> respecting
this Treatise, under the signature of J. M., I feel great obligation
both to the editor of that journal, and the editor of the Treatise
itself, for having brought it to light by publication, and added it to
the stock of accurate and very important historical information. Indeed,
a real vacancy was left for it; and it is a subject of high
self-gratulation, that a boon previously, and for a length of time,
hidden and unproductive, is now accessible and operative without limit.
I have no doubt that all your readers, and the whole reading public,
join with me in rejoicing that the editorship of the work has fallen
into hands so competent and so successful.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn1"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#queries1" class="label">[1]</a> Vol. i., pp. 263. 357.;
Vol. ii., pp. 136. 168. 446. 490.</p>

<p>I was, not for ten, but twenty years or more, in quest of the MS. now so
happily made public property, and should have fallen upon it much
earlier, but for the misleading title under which it appears, where it
<i>is</i> really; for it has been found. In the <i>Catalogus Lib. MSS.</i>: Ox.
1697, among the Laudian MSS. appears, p. 62., "968.95. <i>A Treatise</i>
against <i>Equivocation, or fraudulent Dissimulation</i>." <i>Against!</i> when no
such word is in the original, and the real matter and meaning is <i>for</i>!
I had, at some early time, marked the very entry; but presuming that the
work had been actually <i>printed</i> (which I believe it was in a very few
copies, which have disappeared), naturally enough I did not pursue the
search in that direction. Others, I am happy, have, and I am gratified.</p>

<p>The work is very important; for there is not a work more evidently
genuine and authentic than this is proved to be by plain historic
evidence, both as to the document itself and the facts which it attests.
The witness, or witnesses, appearing in it, give their testimony
respecting themselves with the most unsuspectable simplicity. They meant
not, and have not, misrepresented themselves: they have proclaimed their
own doctrine for themselves respecting Equivocation and Mental
Reservation&mdash;the last of which is really of most importance; and it was
most needful to the Roman body at the time, and under their
circumstances. Their object, for mere safety, was concealment as to
their resorts or residences. They could not exist, as they did, without
the assistance and knowledge of many individuals, some of inferior
class. Against the incessant inquiries to which they were exposed they
had no defence, except the power of disappointing or misleading by
ambiguity or deception, which was completely secured by reserved
termination in the mind to any uttered declaration. Now, there is in
this very Treatise <i>plain admission</i> that all the co-religionists of the
endangered party, particularly a lady who is distinctly noticed, were
not convinced of the moral rectitude of such a procedure; and it was
necessary, or expedient, that their hesitation should be removed. And
this seems to be the main object of the present work. How far it has
succeeded must depend upon the evidence which is adduced.</p>

<p>We have generally had the doctrine of the Roman body on the subject of
the Treatise presented by opponents; here we have it as deliberately
stated by themselves. There is a passage rather observable in p. 103.,
beginning at the bottom and extending to the words "he hath no such
meaning to tell them," of which we are not acquainted with a duplicate.
But the whole has something of the freshness and interest of novelty.</p>

<p><i>Macbeth</i>, it is agreed, I believe, was written in 1607, consequently
after the Powder Plot, when the doctrine before us was brought forward
pointedly against the traitors. Might there not be some reference to the
fact in the Second Act, where the porter of the castle, roused by
repeated knockings, on the murder, after other exclamations in the
manner of the poet, proceeds:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"Here's an Equivocator, that could swear in both the scales,
   against either scale: who committed treason enough for God's
   sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven. Oh, come in,
   Equivocator"?</p>

<p>Mr. Jardine will thank your correspondent for pointing out an error or
two which should be corrected in another edition. At p. 44., for
"<span title="[Greek: chtho]">&#967;&#952;&#959;</span>," in the margin, should be printed "<i>sub verbo</i>." The
word in the MS. is a contraction to that effect:<a id="Page_420"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[420]</span> the capital "V"
has a curved stroke across the first line of the "V," followed by
"<i>bo</i>." Generally the <i>Dubium</i>, in alphabetic works of the kind referred
to, ranks under some alphabetic word, one or more, as it may happen; but
in Em. Sà's work the word <i>Dubium</i> comes under the letter D., and this
is meant to be expressed. At p. 49. the footnote should be omitted, as
the Vulgate, which is followed, calls the 1st of <i>Samuel</i> the 1st of
<i>Kings</i>. The first line of p. 56. should have "<i>autem</i>" instead of
"<i>antea</i>." I have inspected the MS. carefully, and therefore speak with
confidence.</p>

scopulo <i>infigendi</i> voc. accommodatius videtur quam <i>infligendi</i>." And
Wagner: "acuto scopulo <i>infigi</i> melius."</p>

<p>This interpretation and these criticisms are founded altogether on a
false conception of the meaning of the word <i>infigere</i>, which is never
to fix <i>on</i>, but always either to fix <i>in</i>, or to fix <i>with</i>, i.e.
pierce <i>with</i>. <i>Scopulo infixit acuto</i>, <i>fixed or pinned</i> down or to the
ground <i>with</i> a sharp rock; <i>i.e.</i> hurled a sharp-pointed rock on him,
so as to nail him to the ground. So
 (<i>Æn.</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">XII.</span> 721.) "Cornua obnixi
infigunt," fix their horns, not <i>on</i>, but <i>in</i>; infix their horns; stick
their horns into each other; stick each other with their horns: <i>q.d.</i>
Cornibus se mutuo infigunt: and, exactly parallel to our text:</p>

<p>In confirmation of this view of the passage, I may observe: 1st, that it
is easier to imagine a man staked to the ground by a sharp-pointed rock,
than flung on a sharp-pointed rock, so as to remain permanently impaled
on it; and 2dly, that the account given of the transaction, both by
Quintus Calaber and Seneca, agree as perfectly with this view as they
disagree with the opposite:</p>

<p>So understood, 1st, the passage is according to Virgil's usual manner,
the latter part of the line explaining and defining the general
statement contained in the former; and, 2ndly, Pallas kills her enemy,
not by the somewhat roundabout and unusual method of first striking him
with thunder, and then snatching him up in a whirlwind, and then either
dashing him against a sharp rock, and leaving him impaled there, or, as
I have shown is undoubtedly the meaning, impaling him with a sharp rock,
but by the more compendious and less out-of-the-way method of first
striking him with thunder, and then whirling a sharp-pointed rock on top
of him, so as to impale him.</p>

<p>From Milton's imitation of this passage, in his <i>Paradise Lost</i> (ii.
180.), it appears that even he fell into the general and double error:</p>

     <p> "Caught in a fiery tempest shall be hurled,</p>

<p>And so also Holdsworth and Ruæus.</p>

<p>I think, on the contrary, that <i>incedo</i>, both here and elsewhere,
expresses only the stepping or walking motion generally, and that the
character of the step or walk, if inferable at all, is to be inferred
only from the context. Accordingly, "Magnifice incedit"
(Liv. <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> 6.);
"Turpe incedere" (Catull. <span class="smcap lowercase">XXXXII.</span> 8.); "Molliter incedit" (Ovid, <i>Amor.</i>
<span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> 23.); "Passu incedit inerti" (Ovid, <i>Metam.</i> II. 772.); "Melius est
incessu regem quam imperium regno claudicare"
(Justin. <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span> ii. 6.);
"Incessus omnibus animalibus certus et uniusmodi, et in suo, cuique,
genere" (Plin. <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span> 38.).</p>

<p>The emphasis, therefore, is on <i>regina</i>, and the meaning is, <i>I who
step, or walk, <span class="smcap lowercase">QUEEN</span> of the Gods</i>; the dignity of the step being not
expressed by "incedo," but inferable from "regina." The expression
corresponds exactly to "ibit regina" (<i>Æn.</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> 578.); with this
difference only, that "ibit" does not, like "incedo," specify motion on
foot.</p>

<p>"Jovisque et soror et conjux."&mdash;Both the <i>ets</i> are emphatic. "Jovisque
<i>et</i> soror <i>et</i> conjux."</p>

<p>"Bella" expresses the organised resistance which she meets, and the
uncertainty of the issue; and being placed first word in the line is
emphatic.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Justice to Pope Pius V.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;You have done yourself credit by exonerating
Queen Elizabeth from a charge the easiest to bring, and the most
difficult to rebut, implying the proof of a negative; and therefore
frequently brought by the unprincipled. I propose, as a counterpart, to
exonerate Pope Pius V. from an imputation, mistakingly, though unjustly,
cast upon him by an authority of no less weight than that of Sir Walter
Scott. In his edition of <i>Somers's Tracts</i>, vol. i. p. 192., occurs a
note on a place in the <i>execution of justice</i>: "Pius V. resolved to make
his bastard son, Boncompagni, Marquis of Vincola, King of Ireland," &amp;c.
For this assertion no authority is cited, nor indeed could be. The very
name might have suggested the filiation to his successor, Gregory XIII.,
which was the fact. In a work, not much known, <i>The Burnt Child dreads
the Fire, &amp;c.</i>, by William Denton, M.D., London, 1675, at p. 25. we
read, "Gregory XIII. had a bastard, <i>James Buon Compagna</i>, and to him he
gave <i>Ireland</i>, and impowered <i>Stewkely</i> with men, arms, and
money,<a id="Page_422"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[422]</span> to conquer it for him."<a id="him2"></a><a title="Go to footnote 2." href="#fn2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> There is no reason to doubt,
that with the editor of the <i>Tracts</i> the above imputation was a simple
mistake; but it is an important duty of all who interfere with
historical literature, to state and correct every discovered instance of
the kind.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn2"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#him2" class="label">[2]</a> Camden,
 in his <i>Elizabeth</i>, under 1578, states the fact
without mention of the name, only calling him "the pope's bastard;" but
the date is the sixth year of the pontificate of Gregory XIII.</p>

<h3>
<span>CROSSES AND CRUCIFIXES.</span>
</h3>

<p>In the 22nd volume of the <i>Archæologia</i>, p. 58., is the following
passage:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The cross, which does not appear to have been peculiar to
   Christianity, when introduced on these obelisks, is usually
   filled with tracery."</p>

<p>The obelisks, or stones of memorial, referred to are the subjects of a
very interesting paper communicated by Mr. Logan to the Society of
Antiquaries. (See Plates 2, 3, 4, and 5.) I am desirous of being
informed what authenticated instances there are of crosses, or stones
marked with crosses, being used for landmarks, memorials, or for any
other purpose, civil or religious, before the introduction of
Christianity? I have met with one instance. Prescott, in his <i>History of
Mexico</i>, relates that&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "In the court of one of the temples in the island of Columel he
   was amazed by the sight of a cross of stone and lime, about ten
   palms high."</p>

<p>It was the emblem of the god of rain (See vol. i. p. 240., &amp;c.)</p>

<p>In the same paper Mr. Logan observes&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Crosses, or stones on which the figure was traced, marked a
   place of meeting for certain districts; and within memory of man
   a fair was held on this spot. It is not improbable that
   market-crosses may be deduced from this custom."</p>

<p>It seems that every town that had the privilege of a market or fair (I
am speaking of England) had a market-cross. In most of these towns the
cross has disappeared, and in its place a ball or globe has been mounted
on the shaft; but the term "market-cross" is still in use. In the town
of Giggleswick, in the parish of Giggleswick, there is a perfect
market-cross, the cross being what is, I believe, called a cross-fleury.
In the town of Settle, in the same parish of Giggleswick, the ball or
globe is placed on the top of the shaft. Are there other instances of
market towns in which the cross is still found?</p>

<p>I passed through a market town lately in which the stone steps, and
socket in which the shaft was placed, are preserved; but they have been
removed to one corner of the market-place. The shaft and cross have
disappeared.</p>

<p>Is not this erection of the cross, in places in which markets and fairs
were held, of ecclesiastical origin? Was the cross erected by licence
granted by the bishop within whose jurisdiction it was placed? Is there
any grant of such licence in existence? Or did these crosses originate
in the gratuitous piety of our ancestors? I fear to ask the question,
whether the buyers and sellers under the cross are more upright in their
dealings than those who buy and sell without the presence of this emblem
of all that is true and just. Is the cross erected in the cities and
towns of other states, as in England? Was the custom general in Europe?</p>

 <p class="right">F. W. J.</p>

<p>Mr. Curzon states, in the introduction to his <i>Monasteries of the
Levant</i>, that&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"The crucifix was not known before the fifth or sixth century,
   though the cross was always the emblem of the Christian faith."</p>

<p>I am persuaded that this assertion is incorrect, and that the crucifix
was used in much earlier times. Will some one kindly inform me where the
first mention of it is to be found, and what is the date of the earliest
examples now known?</p>

<h3>
<span>MASTER OF THE BUCKHOUNDS.</span>
</h3>

<p>In reading the <i>Topographer</i> for January 1791 (a work which was
published under the editorship of my uncle, Sir Egerton Brydges), I was
surprised to find, in an account of the family of Brocas, of
Beaurepaire, in the county of Hampshire, that the post of Master of the
Buckhounds had been sold in the reign of James I.</p>

<p>Mr. Gough (<i>Sepulchral Monuments</i>, pp. 160, 161.) appears to be the
authority quoted who describes the monument of Sir Bernard Brocas, Kt.,
as existing at Westminster, and having on it an inscription in which is
the following sentence:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Sir Bernard succeeded to the paternal inheritance both in
   England and France, and having married Mary, daughter and heiress
   of Sir John de Roche, had a large estate with her, and the
   hereditary post of Master of the Buckhounds; which was confirmed
   to him by King Edward the Third, and held by the family, till
   sold in James the First's reign."</p>

<p>I have no means of ascertaining at the present time whether this
monument is still in existence or not; nor indeed has that much to do
with the object of my writing, which is to suggest the following
Queries, in the hope that some of your correspondents may be able to
send satisfactory answers.</p>

<p>1. By whom was the post of Master of the Buckhounds first instituted,
and who was the first Master?<a id="Page_423"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[423]</span></p>

<p>2. Is there any list of persons holding this office; and if so, where
may it be seen?</p>

<p>3. Is there any instance of an unmarried lady having held it: for in the
case before us we see that a lady was able to convey it by inheritance
to her husband?</p>

<p>4. By whom was it sold? Was it by the last hereditary possessor; and if
so, what was his name? Or was it by the king, on the death of one of the
possessors, for the purpose of enriching himself?</p>

<p>5. Is it known whether there is any other instance of its having been
sold: and when did it come to be, as now, a ministerial office?</p>

in the morning, and gains its strength after the sun has risen. These
insects live ten or fifteen days, and never seem to eat any food. They
come in swarms, and birds, pigs, and poultry fatten on them. The female
lays her eggs in the outermost twigs of the forest; these die and drop
on the ground. The eggs give birth to a number of small grubs, which are
thus enabled to attain the mould without injury, and in it they
disappear; they are forgotten till seventeen years pass, and then the
memory of them returns, and they rise from the earth, piercing their way
through the matted sod, the hard trampled clay, &amp;c. They appeared in
1749, &amp;c., to 1834, and are expected in 1851. Has this expectation been

But there was a <i>fourth</i> son, Roderic, who settled in England, and
appears to have been residing there for some time, when the fatal
rupture occurred between the two countries. It would appear that
descendants of his have lived, and are living in our own times; among

<p class="blockquot">[These relate most probably to the palatine rights of the Bishops
   of Durham, granted by Egfrid, King of Northumbria, in 685; when
   he gave to St. Cuthbert all the land between the Wear and the
   Tyne, called "the patrimony of St. Cuthbert," to hold in as full
   and ample a manner as the king himself holds the same. This
   donative, with its ancient customs and privileges, was confirmed
   by the Danes, and afterwards by William the Conqueror; in
   addition to which, the latter made the church a sanctuary, and
   the county a palatinate. Its bishop was invested with as great a
   power and prerogative within his see, as the king exercised
   without the bounds of it, with regard to forfeitures, &amp;c. Thus it
   was a kind of royalty subordinate to the crown, and, by way of
   eminence, was called <i>The Bishoprick</i>. For an account of the

<h3>
<span>CONVOCATION OF YORK.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 368.)</span>
</h3>

<p>This body (of which I am a member) ought to meet on the same occasions
with that of Canterbury; but owing to the neglect or the wilfulness of
its officials, many omissions and mistakes occur. I have heard a
commission to <i>further</i> adjourn the Convocation, from a day to which it
previously stood adjourned, read the day <i>after</i> that on which it ought
to have assembled, but which day had arrived and passed without any one
recollecting the fact! Our Convocation appears at no time to have acted
a very prominent part, though its constitution is far better fitted for
a working synod than that of the southern province. In the latter the
<i>parochial</i> clergy are so inadequately represented as to be much
outnumbered by the <i>dignitaries</i> appointed by the crown and the bishops;
but in York there are <i>two</i> proctors chosen by the clergy of <i>each</i>
archdeaconry and peculiar jurisdiction, and <i>two</i> by each cathedral
chapter; thus affording a complete counterpoise to the deans and
archdeacons who are members <i>ex officio</i>. Another peculiarity in the
Convocation of York is, that it assembles in <i>one</i> house, the bishops
commonly appearing by their proxies (priests), and the archbishop
presiding by his commissioner, who is always the dean, or one of the
residentiary canons of York.</p>

<p>In 1462 (<i>temp.</i> Archbishop Booth) the Convocation of York decreed that
such constitutions of the province of Canterbury as were not prejudicial
to those of York should be received, incorporated, and deemed as their
own (Wilkins's <i>Concilia</i>, vol. iii. p. 580.). Under Archbishop
Grenefeld it was decreed that since the Archbishop of York hath no
superior in spirituals except the Pope, no appeals should be suffered to
the Archbishop of Canterbury (p. 663.). At an earlier period the
northern metropolitan laid claim to all England north of the Humber,
with the whole realm of Scotland (Wilkins, vol. i. pp. 325, 479, &amp;c.).
In a provincial council at London, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1175, his jurisdiction was
denied over the sees of Lincoln, <i>Chester</i>, Worcester, and Hereford,
upon which he appealed to the Pope. With the exception of Chester,
however, none of these sees were finally retained in the province.</p>

<p>The next year we are told that, in a (national) council at Westminster,
the Pope's legate presiding, the Archbishop of York, "disdaining to sit
at the left hand of the legate, forced himself into the lap of the
Archbishop of Canterbury, but was immediately <i>knocked down</i> by the
other bishops and clergy, severely beaten, and thrust out of the
council!" (Hoveden ap. Wilkins, vol. i. p. 485.) How far the Northern
Convocation supported their burly prelate in these claims I do not know;
but I <i>note</i> that in those days the disorderly conduct of the clergy was
<i>not</i> made a pretext for the indefinite suspension of synodical
functions; and I <i>query</i> whether the clergy might not be trusted to
behave quite as well in the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>But to return to the Convocation of York. There is a curious letter,
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1661, from Accepted Frewen, Archbishop of York, to the Convocation,
desiring them to send up to London some of their members duly
commissioned on their part to sit<a id="Page_426"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[426]</span> with the Lower House of
Canterbury for the review of the Liturgy. In this letter the archbishop
says that himself and the other bishops of the province were sitting
<i>with the bishops of the southern province in their House</i>. A similar
expedient for constituting a <i>quasi</i>-national synod seems to have been
resorted to upon some earlier occasions; but the Convocation of York
still passed in due form by their own separate decree what was so agreed
upon. The Articles were thus subscribed by our Convocation in 1571, and
the Canons in 1604 and 1640.</p>

<p>Since then the Convocation of York has been regularly summoned, met,
adjourned, and been prorogued, without even the dutiful address to the
crown, which is regularly discussed and adopted in Canterbury. In the
year 1847, a spasmodic attempt at life was manifested in this venerable
and ill-used institution. Archbishop Harcourt had consented that an
address to the crown should be adopted, and himself procured a draft to
be approved by the bishops. His grace however died before the day of
meeting. Some difficulty was experienced by the officials, both in York
and London, as to the course to be pursued; but a precedent having been
pointed out in the reign of James I., when Archbishop Hutton died after
summoning the Convocation and before its assembly, a writ was issued
from the crown to the dean and chapter at York to elect a <i>præses</i> for
the Convocation during the vacancy of the archbishoprick. They appointed
the canon who happened to be in residence; an unusually large attendance
was given; the Convocation was opened, the names called over, and then
the officials had reached the limit of their experience; according to
<i>their</i> precedents we ought all to have been sent away. The address
however was called on by the <i>præses</i>, being apparently quite unaware
that a <i>prolocutor</i> should be chosen by the clergy before they proceeded
to business. Such an officer probably seemed to the dignitary already in
the chair like a <i>second King of Brentford</i> "smelling at one rose," and
the demand was refused. Further difficulties ensued, of course, the
moment the debate was opened; and finally, the <i>præses</i>, determined not
to be tempted out of his depth, rose all at once, and read the fatal
<i>formula</i> which restored our glorious Chapter House to its silent
converse with the ghosts. The Convocation has never since been heard of.</p>

<h3>
<span>THE OLD COUNTESS OF DESMOND.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 305.)</span>
</h3>

<p>If your correspondent A. B. R. will refer to Walpole's <i>Fugitive Pieces</i>
he will find a minute inquiry into the person and age of this long-lived
lady. This is doubtless the dissertation alluded to by C. (Vol. ii., p.
219.) Pennant has <i>two</i> notices of the countess in his Scotch tours. In
that of 1769 (which somewhat strangely follows the one of 1772), he
gives at p. 87. the engraving spoken of (Vol. iv., p. 306.), apparently
taken from the original at Dupplin Castle. It differs a little from R's.
description of another portrait, as the cloak is strapped over the
chest, not held by a button. In 1772 Pennant again describes this
portrait in his <i>Tour in Scotland</i>, vol. ii. p. 88., and speaks of four
others, viz., first, at Devonshire House; second, at the Hon. John
Yorke's seat, near Cheltenham; third, at Mr. Scott's, printer; and the
fourth, in the Standard Closet, Windsor Castle. At the back of the last
is written with a pen "Rembrandt." "A mistake (says P.) as Rembrandt was
not fourteen years of age (he was indeed only eight) in 1614, at which
time it is certain the countess was not living."</p>

<p>In my copy of the <i>Fugitive Pieces</i> (the Strawberry Hill edition,
presented by Walpole to Cole), I find the following manuscript note by
Cole; <i>an amplification of the</i> passage from Walpole's letters quoted at
p. 306.:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Being at Strawberry Hill in April, 1773, I saw there a copy of
   the picture commonly attributed to the old Countess of Desmond;
   but Mr. Walpole told me that there is sufficient proof that it is
   a painter's mother, I think Rembrandt's. However, by a letter
   from Mr. Lort, April 15, 1774, he assures me that on Mr.
   Pennant's calling at Strawberry Hill to see this picture, he was
   much chagrined at having a print of it engraved for his book,
   till Mr. Lort revived him by carrying him to a garret in
   Devonshire House, where was a picture of this same countess with
   her name on it, exactly corresponding to his engraved print. I
   remember a tolerable good old picture of her at Mr. Dicey's,
   prebendary of Bristol, at Walton in Bucks."</p>

<p>Walpole could not dismiss Pennant without a disparaging remark. He is "a
superficial man, and knows little of history or antiquity; but he has a
violent rage for being an author." Those who live in glass houses should
not throw stones: Pennant would not have displayed the ignorance which
Walpole exhibits in the instance before us. In an inscription, which the
latter gives, on a Countess of Desmond buried at Sligo, occurs the
following contraction: "Desmoniæ <i>Noie</i> Elizabetha." Walpole says
(<i>Fugitive Pieces</i>, p. 204.), "This word I can make no sense of, but
<i>sic originale</i>; I take it to be redundancy of the carver. It seems to
be a repetition of the last three syllables of Desmoniæ!"</p>

<p>The sarcastic observations which Walpole passes on the Society of
Antiquaries, its members, and its publications, are so frequent and so
bitter, that they must have been founded on some offence not to be
pardoned. Were the remarks on the "Historic Doubts" by the president,
Dean Milles, and by the Rev. Robert Masters (printed in the first two
volumes of the <i>Archæologia</i>), regarded as<a id="Page_427"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[427]</span> satisfactorily
confuting Walpole's arguments; or did he aim, but unsuccessfully, at the
president's chair?</p>

<h3>
<span>COINS OF VABALATHUS.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 255.)</span>
</h3>

<p>There have been many attempts to explain the
puzzling <span class="smcap lowercase">VCRIMDR</span>, on the
supposition that a Latin sentence was concealed under these letters.
Pinkerton suggested "Voluntate Cæsaris Romani Imperatoris Maximi Domini,
Rex." I hope to offer a better solution, which, although not new, has
been passed over, I believe, by all subsequent writers. The Rev. George
North, in the <i>Museum Meadianum</i>, p. 97., gives the following note:
"Apud Arabes accepi verbum Karama significare Honoravit, a quo Ucrima,
et Ucrim; quo sensu respondet hoc Arabicum <span title="[Greek: Tô Sebastô]">&#932;&#8183; &#931;&#949;&#946;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#8183;</span> apud
Græcos." On applying to a well-known scholar and linguist here, I found
that from the verb <i>Karama</i> there was derived the adjective <i>Kar&#299;mat</i>
(nobilis), from which again the superlative <i>Akram</i> comes. There can, I
think, be little doubt that the word
 <span class="smcap lowercase">VCRIMDR</span> is originally derived from
this verb <i>Karama</i>, and that it is most probably equivalent to
<i>Nobilissimus</i>, a title so common shortly afterwards, as applied to the
heirs to the empire.<a id="empire3"></a><a title="Go to footnote 3." href="#fn3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> </p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn3"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#empire3" class="label">[3]</a> "<i>Nobilissimus</i>,
in the Byzantine historians, is synonymous
with Cæsar."&mdash;<i>Niebuhr.</i></p>

<p>The word <span title="[Greek: SRÔIAS]">&#1017;&#929;&#937;&#921;&#913;&#1017;</span> or
<span title="[Greek: SRIAS]">&#1017;&#929;&#921;&#913;&#1017;</span>, which appears on the
Alexandrian coins of this prince, is of more difficult explanation. Some
think it a prænomen, some a Syriac or other Eastern title, perhaps
corresponding to
<span class="smcap lowercase">VCRIMDR</span>. Pellerin thought so. I hope some Oriental
scholar will direct his attention to this point. These coins are very
often ill struck, so that the part of the legend below the head, where
the word in question is found, is indistinct, for which reason I suppose
M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> T<span class="smcap lowercase">AYLOR</span> has
 followed the erroneous reading of Banduri, <span title="[Greek: HERMIAS]">&#917;&#929;&#924;&#921;&#913;&#1017;</span>
(properly <span title="[Greek: HERMIAS]">&#1013;&#929;&#924;&#921;&#913;&#1017;</span>, with lunate epsilon) for
<span title="[Greek: SRÔIAS]">&#1017;&#929;&#937;&#921;&#913;&#1017;</span>, which has been corrected by Eckhel. Of three specimens which I
possess, one only reads clearly
<span title="[Greek: SRÔIAS]">&#1017;&#929;&#937;&#921;&#913;&#1017;</span>, from the
above-mentioned cause, but it is unquestionably the correct reading on
all. The best arrangement of the legend, from analogy with those forms
used by the Romans, is as follows:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p><span title="[Greek: AUTokratôr . SRÔIAS . OUABALLATHOS]">&#913;&#933;&#932;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#969;&#961; . &#1017;&#929;&#937;&#921;&#913;&#1017; . &#927;&#933;&#913;&#914;&#913;&#923;&#923;&#913;&#920;&#927;&#1017; . &#913;&#920;&#919;&#925;&#927;&#948;&#969;&#961;&#959;&#965; . &#933;&#953;&#959;&#962;.</span></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The existence of coins, of which I possess a specimen also, reading</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p><span title="[Greek: A . SRIAS . OUABALLATHOS . ATHÊN . U.]">&#913; . &#1017;&#929;&#921;&#913;&#1017; . &#927;&#933;&#913;&#914;&#913;&#923;&#923;&#913;&#920;&#927;&#1017; . &#913;&#920;&#919;&#925; . &#933;.</span></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">shows that we must not read
<span title="[Greek: ATHÊNOU]">&#913;&#920;&#919;&#925;&#927;&#933;</span> as one word, but must
divide it as above. I think M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> T<span class="smcap lowercase">AYLOR</span> will find his specimen to read as
the last-mentioned coin, the
<span title="[Greek: ER]">&#917;&#929;</span> (properly
<span title="[Greek: ER]">&#1013;&#929;</span>) being
<span title="[Greek: SR]">&#1017;&#929;</span>, and the
<span title="[Greek: AU]">&#913;&#933;</span> in like manner
<span title="[Greek: AS]">&#913;&#1017;</span>. My coin
gives the whole legend distinctly, and I can vouch for the exactitude of
the above legend.</p>

<p>I believe there appeared some years ago, in the <i>Revue de Numismatique</i>,
an article on the coins of the Zenobian family, but I do not remember
when it was published, nor the conclusions to which the writer came.
That is, however, the most recent investigation of the subject, and to
it I must refer M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> T<span class="smcap lowercase">AYLOR</span>, as I have not access to that periodical
here.</p>

<p>Sir Gardner Wilkinson has published in the <i>Numismatic Chronicle</i>, vol.
vii. or viii., an inscription containing the names of Zenobia and
Vabalathus. After the name of Vabalathus, who has the title of
Autocrator, is the word
<span title="[Greek: ATHÊNODÔROU]">&#913;&#920;&#919;&#925;&#927;&#916;&#937;&#929;&#927;&#933;</span>, which justifies the
reading
<span title="[Greek: Athênodôrou Huios]">&#913;&#952;&#951;&#957;&#959;&#948;&#969;&#961;&#959;&#965; &#933;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span> on the coins. Vabalathus is thus
probably the son of Zenobia by a former husband, Athenodorus, while
bearing himself the same name, as Vabalathus (better Vaballathus, as on
the Alexandrian coins) is said to be equivalent to Athenodorus, Gift of
Pallas.</p>

<h3>
<span>MARRIAGE OF ECCLESIASTICS.<br />
(Vol. iv., pp. 57, 125, 193, 196, 298.)</span>
</h3>

<p>I entirely agree with you that your pages are not a fit battle-ground
for theological controversy. Still, since the question of the
translation of Heb. xiii. 4. has been mooted, I beg with much deference
to suggest that it will not be quite right to let it fall to the ground
unsettled, especially since
C<span class="smcap lowercase">EPHAS</span> has thought fit to charge those of
our Reformers who translated the Scriptures with mistranslating
advisedly, and with propagating new doctrines.</p>

<p>C<span class="smcap lowercase">EPHAS'S</span> version of the passage is right, and our English version is
wrong; but the fault lies in the ignorance of our translators, an
ignorance which they shared with all the scholars of their day, and many
not bad scholars of our own, of the effect produced on the force of the
article by the relation in which it stands to the other words in the
clause, in point of order.
<span title="[Greek: ho timios gamos]">&#8001; &#964;&#8055;&#956;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#947;&#8049;&#956;&#959;&#962;</span> is "the honourable
marriage;"
<span title="[Greek: ho timios gamos esti]">&#8001; &#964;&#8055;&#956;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#947;&#8049;&#956;&#959;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#8055;</span> is "the honourable marriage
is;"
<span title="[Greek: ho gamos timios]">&#8001; &#947;&#8049;&#956;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#8055;&#956;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span> is untranslateable, unless you supply
<span title="[Greek: esti]">&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#8055;</span>, and then it means "the marriage" (or, marriage in
general, in the abstract) "is honourable." But
<span title="[Greek: estô]">&#7956;&#963;&#964;&#969;</span> might be
supplied, as it is in Heb. xiii. 4., when it will mean, "let marriage be
honourable:" and
<span title="[Greek: timios ho gamos]">&#964;&#8055;&#956;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#8001; &#947;&#8049;&#956;&#959;&#962;</span> has just the same meaning,
with perhaps this difference, that the emphasis falls more distinctly on
<span title="[Greek: timios]">&#964;&#8055;&#956;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span>. The circumstance that the mere assertion that marriage
is honourable in all (men or things), true as it is in itself, ill
accords with the tenor of the passage of which it forms a part, which is
hortatory, not assertive, is a good reason why<a id="Page_428"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[428]</span>
 C<span class="smcap lowercase">EPHAS'S</span> version
should be preferred. But when we find afterwards the words
<span title="[Greek: kai hê koitê amiantos]">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7969; &#954;&#959;&#8055;&#964;&#951; &#7936;&#956;&#8055;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>, it
 is impossible to deny this hortatory force to the
sentence; for those words cannot mean "the undefiled bed:" and to
translate them "the (or their) bed is undefiled"&mdash;which is the only
version which they will here bear, but one&mdash;would give but a feeble
sense. That sole remaining sense is, "the bed (let it) be undefiled;"
subaudite
<span title="[Greek: estô]">&#7956;&#963;&#964;&#969;</span> in the verse is, "Let marriage be honourable in
all" (men or things), "and the bed be undefiled; but (or for)
whoremongers and adulterers God will judge." Had our translators known
that
<span title="[Greek: hê koitê amiantos]">&#7969; &#954;&#959;&#8055;&#964;&#951; &#7936;&#956;&#8055;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span> could not mean "the bed undefiled," they
would at once have been driven to see that the verse is a commandment:
and the commandment that marriage should be held honourable in all men
(or in all respects), would have served the purpose of their doctrines
quite as well as the affirmative form which they have given to their
present version. I say, it would have served their purpose; but I say
more: they heeded not what did or would serve their purpose. They looked
only for the truth and disregarded all else in their pursuit of it. With
regard to the controversy about
<span title="[Greek: en pasi]">&#7952;&#957; &#960;&#8118;&#963;&#953;</span>, it is immaterial which
version be adopted. M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> W<span class="smcap lowercase">ALTER</span> is right in the rule which he enunciates,
if he means that in those cases of adjectives in which the masculine and
neuter forms are the same, "man" or "men," not "thing" or "things," must
be understood: but it is not always observed, even in classical writers,
either in Latin or in Greek. There is no reason why it should be broken
here; and I do not believe it is broken. It must have been only by a
slip of C<span class="smcap lowercase">EPHAS'S</span> pen that he called
<span title="[Greek: pasi]">&#960;&#8118;&#963;&#953;</span> a feminine adjective.
It undoubtedly refers to both sexes. I wish E. A. D. had given the Greek
of the passages from Chrysostom and Augustine, of which he has
communicated the Oxford translation, which is as likely to err, perhaps,
as any other. Jerome's Latin, like the Vulgate, though the words are not
precisely the same, gives a literal version of the Greek, without
supplying any verb at all, either <i>est</i> or <i>sit</i>, and, since the Latin
has not that expressive power in cases like this which the article gives
to the Greek, leaves the passage obscure and undecided.</p>

<p>It is quite obvious what lines your correspondent alludes to, though the
above quotation which he gives as the commencement of them is not quite
correct, nor were they written with the object he supposes.</p>

<p>I send a correct copy of them below, taken from Mr. Payne Collier's very
interesting <i>Life of Shakspeare</i>, to whom they have always been
attributed; and, it is said, with every show of reason. It is supposed
they were written by him in the shape of a complimentary allusion to
King James I., in grateful acknowledgment of the patronage bestowed by
that monarch upon the stage. The subject is fully discussed at pp. 202,
203. of Mr. Knight's volume, whence, indeed, the above information is
derived; and he publishes the lines, as follows, stating then to be
copied from a coeval manuscript in his possession:&mdash;</p>

<p>Some one, to make the allusion more complete, that is, to over-do it,
changed "<i>a</i> king" into "<i>the</i> king" in a subsequent publication of the
lines. But this, as Mr. Payne Collier very justly feels, completely
spoils the whole complexion of the epigram, and perverts a fine allusion

<p>2. As for Isaac Reed's opinion in favour of Farmer's Essay, it might be
met by many of directly opposite tendency, and of at least equal weight.</p>

<p>3. In the only point really in question,
 B<span class="smcap lowercase">OLTON</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORNEY</span> "cannot deny that
Farmer related the anecdote of the <i>wool-man</i>" (that being the
reputed<a id="Page_429"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[429]</span> trade of Shakspeare's father); but to what end was it
related, if not to suggest an application of which Steevens was only the
interpreter?</p>

<p>But B<span class="smcap lowercase">OLTON</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORNEY</span> thinks the character of the witness suspicious; he
forgets that only just before he had stated that the anecdote and its
application had been repeated in three editions, extending over thirteen
years, all within the lifetime of Dr. Farmer!</p>

<span>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</span>
</h3>

<p>Although there are few books which have proved of greater utility to
inquirers into the more recent history of England than Beatson's
<i>Political Index</i>, yet it is also true that there are few which have
more frequently or more justly caused the reader to feel the want of a
new and improved edition. A very short examination, however, of Mr.
Haydn's recently published Beatson's <i>Political Index Modernised, The
Book of Dignities, containing Rolls of the Official Personages of the
British Empire, Civil, Ecclesiastical, Judicial, Military, Naval, and
Municipal, &amp;c.</i>, will satisfy the reader that such want has at length
been supplied in a manner the most ample and the most satisfactory. For
though we have referred to Beatson's well-known work for the purpose of
furnishing a better idea of the <i>Book of Dignities</i>, we are bound to
acknowledge that Mr. Haydn is justified in stating, that in the work in
question he owes little more than the plan to Beatson. Mr. Haydn's
volume not only contains many lists (among them the "Administrations of
England, and the Judges of the Ecclesiastical Courts") not to be found
in the <i>Political Index</i>, but the author has had the advantage of being
permitted to search the various official records with the view of
enabling him to give complete and accurate information. The result, of
course, is obvious; namely, that just in the same proportion that our
author surpasses Beatson in the extent and accuracy of his various
lists, does the <i>Book of Dignities</i> exceed its predecessor in usefulness
to the official man, the historian, and the scholar.</p>

<p>Mr. Hunt's experience as a public lecturer at the various literary and
scientific institutions of the country, having convinced him that for
the majority of the members of those institutions most of the existing
works on natural philosophy are of too abstruse and technical a
character&mdash;are, in short, sealed books,&mdash;he has been led to publish a
small volume which we have no doubt will soon become extremely popular.
It is entitled <i>Elementary Physics, an Introduction to the Study of
Natural Philosophy</i>; and, as its object is to teach physical science so
far as to render all the great deductions from observation and
experiment satisfactorily clear, without encountering the difficulty of
mathematics,&mdash;and no one is better able to do this, and throw a charm
over such a subject, than the author of the <i>Poetry of Science</i>,&mdash;the
work, which is illustrated with upwards of two hundred woodcuts, will be
found eminently useful; not only to those who have neither time nor
opportunity to carry their studies beyond its pages, but especially as a
"first book" to those in whom it may awaken the desire for a more
perfect knowledge of the beautiful and important truths of which it
treats.</p>

<p>The nature of the <i>Hand Atlas of Physical Geography, consisting of a
Series of Maps and Illustrations, showing the Geographical Distribution
of Natural Phenomena, embracing the Divisions of Geology, Hydrography,
Meteorology, Natural History: from the Physikalischer Atlas of Berghaus,
and the Maps of the Erdkunde, drawn by and under the immediate
Superintendence of Drs. Ritter and Kiepert, Oetzel, Grimm, &amp;c., by the
Editor of the University Atlas of the Middle Ages</i>, is sufficiently
described by its ample title-page; which shows, moreover, that the work
is not a mere copy or reduction of the great atlas of Berghaus, on which
it is founded. As a companion to the works of Humboldt, Mrs. Somerville,
and other writers on physical geography, it will be found most useful;
while its convenient size, and moderate price, place it within the reach
of almost all classes of readers.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
